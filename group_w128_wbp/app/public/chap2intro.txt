  -Introduction and key messages

~
	Reducing emissions from electricity generation and then using low-carbon
	electricity to power the economy is a central part of reaching Net Zero. Sector
	emissions have fallen rapidly over the last decade, and the Government has made
	a strong commitment to fully decarbonise the sector by 2035. The key challenge is
	now to ensure that these ambitions are delivered on, and that available low-
	carbon electricity can be fully utilized and is sufficiently reliable and resilient.
	Our key messages are:
~
	• Emissions. Largely due to a combination of nuclear outages and
		exceptionally low windspeeds, emissions from electricity generation rose by
			10% in 2021 compared to 2020 levels. With coal now all but removed, this
		highlights the need to continue the rapid expansion of zero-carbon
		generation and develop flexible low-carbon alternatives to gas.
~
	• Policy progress. In the past year the Government has committed to
		electricity generation being 95% low-carbon by 2030 and fully
		decarbonised by 2035. It has also made stretching commitments to
		increase low-carbon capacity from renewables and nuclear, although
		these have some delivery risks. Overall, credible plans are in place for over
		half the emissions reduction required in 2035.
~
	• Recommendations and next steps. The overriding challenge is now to
		ensure that the Government’s ambitions are delivered.
~	
	• The Committee will publish a report later in 2022 setting out how a
		decarbonised and resilient electricity system could be delivered.
		The evidence underpinning these key messages is set out in four sections as follows:
			1. Emissions trends and drivers
			2. Indicators of progress
			3. Policy progress, assessment and next steps
			4. Major risks
