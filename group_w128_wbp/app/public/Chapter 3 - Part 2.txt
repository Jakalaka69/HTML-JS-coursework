Indicators of progress
This section sets out the key indicators of progress for the aviation sector. There has
been some progress on the technologies required for the transition within the
sector through the FlyZero project by the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), but
no progress has been made in addressing demand.
~
The actions and conditions required for the decarbonisation of aviation in the UK
are summarised in Figure 9.3. The details of how these work together to deliver the
sector’s decarbonisation pathway, along with a full set of data indicators designed
to track each of these elements, are introduced in the accompanying Monitoring
Framework. Progress this year on the key indicators is shown in Table 9.1 and Figures
9.4 to 9.12. Progress on the full set of indicators is shown in the supporting data to
this report.
~
	• Fossil fuel use per passenger-km increased substantially in 2020 (72%
increase on 2019 levels) after two decades of progress to improve fuel
efficiency, with an annual average change of -3% from 2010-2019 (Figure
9.4). This is likely to be due to reduced passenger demand and flights with a
lower proportion of seats filled, including an increasing number of ‘ghost’
flights (Figure 9.5). It is important to track this as the sector recovers from the
pandemic to ensure that it is only a temporary move away from long-term
efficiency trends and that policies are implemented to alter routes and
restrict ‘ghost flights’ if the pattern is not temporary.
~
	• Non-CO2 effects of aviation* have reduced as a result of the pandemic,
after increasing in previous years in-line with the growing number of flights.
Technological progress in the aviation sector primarily drives a reduction in
CO 2 emissions-intensity, although there may be some small reductions in
non-CO 2 effects. The most effective way of mitigating non-CO 2 emissions is
through controlling demand for aviation (Figure 9.6).
~
	• The number of international trips attributed to business travel fell significantly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The price elasticity of demand for business
travel has historically been low, although with the much greater use of
video-conferencing during the pandemic, the extent to which business
aviation travel returns remains uncertain. There has been no policy change
to attempt to maintain this trend of fewer business flights and, resulting
lower demand and emissions (Figure 9.7).
~
•	 Prices per passenger-km of air travel have been decreasing since 2010 for
short- and long-haul travel (despite increases in the Air Passenger Duty for
ultra-long-haul flights). These price changes indicate improvements in the
efficiency of aircraft and reductions in fuel consumption. Prices for long-
distance rail journeys have increased substantially over the same period. To
mitigate demand and reduce consumption, prices of air travel ought to be
more expensive than lower emission modes to reflect the higher emissions
of air travel relative to alternatives (Figure 9.8 and 9.9).
~
* Aviation non-CO 2 effects (including contrails, NOx emissions, sulphates and other factors) warm the climate but have
high levels of uncertainty and exhibit regional and seasonal variation. Despite uncertainties, their net effect almost
certainly contributes a warming effect to the climate.
No progress has been made in
addressing demand in the
aviation sector, despite the
significant risks in the
technology required to
decarbonise flying.
~
Fossil fuel intensity in aviation
has increased during the
pandemic.
~
Non-CO2 effects from aviation
have fallen during the
pandemic.
~
The cost of flying does not
reflect the emissions impact
relative to lower-emission forms
of travel.
~
	• An increasing proportion of people are thinking about the impact of air
travel on the environment and are willing to pay more for their flights to
reflect the environmental cost of air travel (Figures 9.10 and 9.11).
~
	• 26 billion seat-kms flown in 2021 were offset by airlines out of a possible 114
billion (Figure 9.12). This is likely to increase once the Carbon Offsetting and
Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is fully operational
and airlines start buying offsets through this programme.
		– The proportion of domestic flights offset is significantly higher than
international flights, which rely more heavily on voluntary carbon
offsetting by consumers. Only around 4% of consumers opt for these
offsets according to research on the willingness-to-pay for carbon
dioxide offsets.1
		– However, the quality of offsets currently used is generally low and are
often purchased by companies at a relatively low cost. To meet the
emissions pathway for aviation by 2050, near-permanent, sustainable
greenhouse gas removals must be used to balance residual aviation
emissions.*
~
	• UK aviation emissions per person in 2019, before the pandemic, were 33%
higher than the OECD average (Figure 9.13). Other countries are moving
faster than the UK with policies to reduce their aviation emissions. Box 9.1
provides a summary of key policy developments internationally over the
last few years.
~
	• We do not include an indicator on zero- or low-emission aircraft as they are
not currently commercially viable. However, we summarise the progress on
research into the possibility of low-emission aircraft through the Aerospace.
~
The aviation industry is
offsetting a substantial
proportion of flights, although
the quality of the offsets
purchased is generally low.

~
* Removals must be sustainable, UK-based, with the quantity of CO 2 removed and the permanency of the removal
quantified in a robust and transparent way.
~
Fossil fuel intensity was
improving up to 2020. During
the COVID-19 pandemic it
worsened due to lower
demand and seat occupancy.
~
Seat occupancy fell and the
number of ‘ghost’ flights
increased during the
pandemic, a likely driver for
increased fuel intensity in Figure
9.4.
~
Non-CO2 effects
Aviation non-CO2 effects warm the climate but have high levels of uncertainty and
exhibit regional and seasonal variation. Despite uncertainties, their net effect
almost certainly contributes a warming effect to the climate. Best estimates
suggest that they account for the majority of global aviation’s warming impact on
the planet to date. However, they are likely not as dominant for UK emissions, as UK
aviation emissions are rising more slowly than the global average.
~
	• Figure 9.6 shows an estimate of the change in effective radiative forcing
(ERF, heat trapping potential) from non-CO 2 effects (including contrails, NOx
emissions, sulphates and other factors) from UK aviation (using UK
passenger-kms as a proportion of total global passenger-kms from aviation)
relative to the change in ERF from CO 2 emissions. Globally in 2018, non-CO 2
effects sum to yield a net warming ERF. The climate impacts of non-CO 2
effects are shorter-lived than those of CO2 and depend on sustained
aviation activity to maintain them (unlike CO2 , which will continue to warm
the climate even if emissions were stopped).
~
	• The 76% fall in air passenger demand due to COVID-19 and the short-lived
nature of non-CO 2 effects results in a corresponding percentage reduction
in the radiative forcing from aviation non-CO 2 effects. For comparison,
radiative forcing from CO2 emissions would have remained largely
unchanged.
~
The non-CO2 effects of aviation
in the UK fell during the
pandemic but remain a net
positive impact. The impact of
non-CO2 emissions is highly
uncertain.
~
Business travel was falling as a
proportion of total air travel
even before the COVID-19
pandemic.
~
Prices for both short- and long-
haul air travel are falling as a
result of efficiency
improvements, while rail prices
are increasing.
~
The proportion of people
thinking about the impact of
their air travel on the
environment is increasing.
~
An increasing proportion of
travellers are willing to pay
more for their flights to reduce
the environmental impact of air
travel.
~
The UK’s per-capita aviation
emissions were slightly above
the OECD average prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic. During
the pandemic, the UK was
below average.
~
The ‘FlyZero’ programme has
made significant progress in
understanding the potential of
zero-emission aircraft. However,
uncertainties on the timelines
for commercial availability of
these aircraft remain.
