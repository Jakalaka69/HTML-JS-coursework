Indicators of progress
~
This section sets out the key indicators for monitoring progress in reducing emissions
from electricity supply, towards full decarbonisation by 2035.
Figure 6.6 summarises the key outcomes and conditions required to deliver the
decarbonisation of electricity supply. A description of how these components
combine to deliver the sector’s decarbonisation pathway can be found in our
accompanying Monitoring Framework.
~
A subset of these indicators, focusing on renewables, are included in this report,
with key indicators set out in Table 6.1 and Figures 6.7-6.9:
~
	• Operational capacity. The indicator pathways reflect the Government’s
objectives as set out in the Energy Security Strategy (ESS) for offshore wind
and solar (see Section 3a), and is in line with our Balanced Pathway for
onshore wind.
~
	• Construction pipeline. This reflects the annual flow of projects required to
enter construction, taking into account average timings. For offshore wind
and solar, the annual amounts entering construction will need to ramp up
significantly over the 2020s to be on track for the Government’s objectives
for installed capacity.
~
	• Consenting pipeline. This reflects the annual flow of projects required to
enter the consenting process. These are relatively front-loaded, given
average timings and completion rates.
We will publish a wider set of indicators, covering the full scope of the monitoring
map, in a separate report to be published later in 2022.

This section focuses on
indicators for renewables. We
will publish a wider set of
indicators in a separate report
later in 2022.
~
The ESS set out stretching
ambitions for growth in
capacity of offshore wind and
solar, but there was less focus
on onshore wind.
~
The pathways require a
ramping up of construction
over the 2020s.
~
Capacity needs to enter the
consenting stage significantly in
advance of when it is required
to be deployed.
