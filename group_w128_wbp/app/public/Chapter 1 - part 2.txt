Global climate, emissions and adaptation
~
Global mean temperatures continue to rise due to continued global GHG
emissions. Despite calls for a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic
and record levels of generation from renewable sources, fossil fuel usage
rebounded strongly in 2021. This has resulted in a rebound in emissions, with initial
estimates for 2021 suggesting that the pandemic-related drop in global GHG
emissions in 2020 has largely been regained.
~
This section covers the key indicators of global climate change and adaptation in
three subsections:
	(a) Global climate change
	(b) Global greenhouse gas emissions
	(c) Global progress on adaptation
	(a) Global climate change
	~
Strengthened evidence on the impact of human activity on our planet has been
accompanied by sustained increases in global temperature and severe weather
events. Despite cooling effects from a La Niña event in 2021, the past seven years
have been the warmest seven years on record.5
~
The IPCC summarised the latest science on physical climate change in their Sixth
Assessment Cycle Working Group I (WGI) report, presenting unequivocal evidence
for the impact of human influence on the climate (Box 1.2).6 Human activity is
warming the climate by around 0.25ºC a decade and is identified as the main
driver of unprecedented changes across our climate system, some of which are
irreversible. Estimated human-induced global warming has reached 1.2ºC above
pre-industrial (1850–1900) temperatures (Fig. 1.1).
~
Despite widespread calls for a
sustainable recovery from the
COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 has
seen a rebound in emissions,
increasing use of coal and
worsening climate impacts.
~
Human influence is warming
the climate at rates
unprecedented for thousands
of years.
~
(b) Global greenhouse gas emissions
Rapid and deep emissions reductions on the path to Net Zero are required for the
world to meet the Paris temperature goal of keeping warming well below 2ºC
above pre-industrial levels and closer to 1.5ºC (Figure 1.1). The IPCC’s Working
Group III report provides updates to estimated paths consistent with the Paris
temperature goals and considering recent evolution in GHG emissions (Box 1.3).
The rest of this section assesses progress against these pathways.
~
	• Estimates of the global rebound in emissions differ slightly, but they all
suggest that fossil CO2 emissions had returned to around 2019 levels by the
end of 2021(emissions estimates for all GHGs have not yet been calculated
for 2020 and 2021 but are expected to have risen by a comparable
amount).
~
		– The Global Carbon Project estimate that fossil CO2 emissions fell by
5.4% in 2020 and increased by 4.8% (range of 4.4–5.4%) in 2021.7
		– Work led by RB Jackson recently published in the journal Environmental
Research Letters estimates that a 5.4% fall in fossil CO2 in 2020 has
been followed by a 4.2% increase in 2021.8
~
		– The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimate that fossil CO2
emissions fell by 5.8% in 2020 and have increased by 6% in 2021.9
~
	• These estimates suggest that if emissions in this year (2022) and in coming
years can be put onto a downward path, 2019 could represent the peak of
global fossil CO2 emissions.
~
	• GHG emissions over 2010–2019 were higher than in any decade in history,
albeit this decade saw a slowing in the rate of emissions growth compared
to 2000–2009(Figure 1.2).2
~
	• Emissions growth varies widely across regions, with the Middle East and the
Asia and Developing Pacific region showing the fastest growth over 2015–
2019 (Figure 1.3). Over this period, the GHG emissions increase in Asia and
the Developing Pacific was more than double the total increase in emissions
from all other regions. However per capita emissions remain almost 50%
lower than in developed countries in 2019.2
A strong rebound in 2021 is
estimated to have returned
levels of fossil CO2 emissions to
around pre-pandemic levels.
~
	• The IPCC WGIII report found that at least 18 countries,* including the UK,
have sustained reductions in both production and consumption emissions
for longer than ten years, driven largely by power sector decarbonisation,
energy efficiency and energy demand reduction.10
~
A strong rebound in 2021 is
estimated to have returned
levels of fossil CO2 emissions to
around pre-pandemic levels.
~
Record levels of greenhouse
gas emissions were seen over
the last decade, albeit with a
decrease in the growth rate
compared to the previous
decade.
~
The Middle East and Asia and
Developing Pacific countries
saw the fastest rates of
emissions growth over 2015–
2019.
~
All sectors have options to
reduce emissions this decade,
with many of these at low cost
or delivering cost savings.
~
(c) Global progress on adaptation
More action on adaptation is needed globally. The Glasgow Climate Pact
emphasises the urgent need for action and support to developing countries in
adapting to climate change. It also launched the two-year ‘Glasgow-Sharm el-
Sheikh’ work programme to better measure and implement the global goal on
adaptation, running until COP28 in 2023.
~
In February 2022, the IPCC released its Working Group II report1 with the latest
evidence on climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability (Box 1.4). It
reported that while adaptation action is underway around the world, there
remains a significant gap between the implemented actions and those needed to
minimise the level of future climate impacts.
~
	• The majority of current adaptation actions are generally valuable but
relatively easier to implement, for example the creation of early warning
systems to alert citizens to forecasted extreme weather enabling them to
make preparations.
~
	• There is only limited evidence of the large-scale transformation and
adaptation of assets and systems to be resilient to future climate conditions
such as the widespread retrofitting of buildings to adapt to future
overheating risks.
~
	• Financing remains a key barrier to adaptation action globally, particularly
in developing countries, with support for exclusively mitigation focused
activities making up two-thirds of total climate finance flows from
developed countries for the most recent reported year (2019)
~
All sectors have options to reduce emissions this decade,
with many of these at low cost
or delivering cost savings.
~
Current global action on
adaptation falls short of what is
required to minimise the level
of future climate impacts, with
lack of financing a key barrier.
~
The IPCC’s WGII report
assessed evidence on climate
impacts, vulnerability and
adaptation.
