Major risks
Table 9.3 shows the key risks for the aviation sector in the Government’s pathway.
As highlighted in Figure 9.17, the primary risk is the heavy reliance on technological
solutions and lack of focus on demand management. Figure 9.17 shows the ‘high
risk’ emissions pathway which would result if the CCC’s energy intensity
assumptions were applied to the Jet Zero Strategy’s demand assumptions.
