1. Emissions trends and drivers
In 2021 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity generation represented
11% of total UK GHG emissions. The vast majority of these emissions were from gas-
fired power stations (Figure 6.1).
Emissions increased by 10% in 2021 compared to 2020, to 48.3 MtCO2e (Figure 6.1).
~
	• This means emissions are tracking substantially (15 MtCO 2e, 44%) above the
Government’s Net Zero Strategy pathway for 2021 (Figure 6.2).
~
	• Emissions remain 8% below pre-pandemic (2019) levels, 69% below 2010
levels, and 76% below 1990 levels, reflecting the almost complete removal
of coal generation from the electricity system during the 2010s.
~
The increase in 2021 emissions reflects both rising demand in response to the easing
of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in the carbon-
intensity of generation:
~
	• Electricity demand. Demand rose by 2% to 285 TWh in 2021, but was still 4%
lower than pre-pandemic levels. This rebound was primarily driven by higher
industrial demand (Figure 6.3).
		– Industrial electricity demand increased by 4%, while commercial and
residential demand both increased by 1% relative to 2020 levels.
		– Overall electricity demand remained below pre-pandemic levels,
reflecting the continuation of restrictions during 2021. Residential
demand was 5% higher and commercial and industrial demand 10%
and 6% lower than in 2019, respectively, reflecting the higher
prevalence of working from home during the pandemic.
		– In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, residential electricity demand
was 4% and 7% respectively lower than in the equivalent periods in
2020. This may be a consequence of increased electricity prices
resulting from higher gas prices, combined with milder weather and
some relaxation of lockdown restrictions during parts of that period.
~
	• Emissions intensity. Emissions intensity rose by 12% in 2021 to 200 gCO2 /kWh.
Low-carbon generation was 9% lower than in 2020 due to low windspeeds
and outages at nuclear plants. Consequently, gas generation and imports
rose to compensate for this, increasing emissions.
		– Low-carbon generation reduced by 9% in 2021.
		~
	• The lowest average windspeeds in a decade led to a 14%
reduction in wind generation in 2021, despite a 5% increase in
capacity. Consequently, the average offshore wind load factor fell
to 37% compared to 46% in 2020, and the average onshore wind
load factor fell to 23% compared to 28% in 2020. There is no clear
evidence this is part of a longer-term trend (Figure 6.4), but we will
continue to monitor this as part of our annual progress tracking.
~
Electricity supply represents 11%
of UK emissions. Sector
emissions increased by 10% in
2021, but have fallen by over
75% since 1990.
~
Electricity demand rose 2% in
2021 compared to 2020, largely
driven by rebounding industrial
demand following COVID-19
restrictions.
~
Emissions intensity rose by 12%
in 2021 compared to 2020.
Low-carbon generation fell by
9% in 2021 compared to 2020,
largely driven by low wind
speeds and nuclear outages.
~
• There was also less sunshine in 2021 compared to 2020, causing a
6% reduction in solar generation. The average solar load factor fell
to 10% compared to 11% in 2020.
~
• Nuclear generation reduced by 9% in 2021, primarily due to plant
outages. This is part of a continued decline in nuclear generation
due to ageing of the UK reactor fleet.
– Fossil fuel generation and imports. To compensate for lower renewable
and nuclear generation, fossil fuel generation increased by 12% and
imports by 37%.
• Gas-fired generation rose by 12% in 2021. Coal generation also
increased, by 15%, but remains only 2% of total supply.
~
• Imports increased by 37%, although they still represent less than
10% of electricity supplied. New interconnectors were opened,
including with Norway, increasing capacity from 5.0 GW to 7.4 GW.
Overall, over half of electricity generation in 2021 came from low-carbon sources,
with the bulk of the remaining generation met by gas (Figure 6.5).
~
Gas generation and imports
both rose in 2021 compared to
2020.
~
In 2021 emissions from
electricity supply were 11% of
total UK GHG emissions, and
were around 75% below 1990
levels as coal has been phased
out.
~
The increase in emissions in
2021 means there is a large
gap to the Government’s Net
Zero Strategy pathway.
Electricity consumption
increased relative to 2020,
largely due to increased
industrial demand.
