Emissions trends and drivers
Overall we estimate that aviation emissions in 2021 were around 15 MtCO2 e, an 8%
reduction on 2020 levels (Figure 9.1). This was primarily driven by continuing
suppressed aviation demand for the whole of 2021 due to the COVID-19
pandemic, while it was only suppressed for three-quarters of 2020. Emissions in 2021
were 62% below pre-pandemic (2019) levels. In 2021 international aviation
continued to make up the large majority (89%) of aviation emissions, with domestic
aviation at 4% and military at 7%.
It remains to be seen whether the pre-COVID trend of emissions increases from
demand growth exceeding reductions from efficiency improvements will continue
once the acute impact of the pandemic has ended:
	• Between 2010 and 2019, aviation emissions increased by 10%. This was
driven by increased demand for international flights being partially offset by
falling demand for domestic flights, together with increased plane loadings,
falls in average flight distance and some efficiency improvements.
	• The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to dampen demand for air travel
(Figure 9.2) and may continue to do so in the next few years, especially
when combined with recent very high oil prices and the rising cost of living.
A 59% reduction in aviation emissions was seen in 2020, and demand at the
beginning of 2022 remained at a similarly suppressed level. It remains
unclear whether demand will return to pre-pandemic levels and how long
such a return might take (see section on policy progress, assessment and
next steps).

International aviation continues
to make up the large majority
of UK aviation emissions, at
89%.

Efficiency improvements
partially offset emissions
increases from increased flight
demand before the COVID-19
pandemic.

The largest source of sector
emissions continues to be from
international aviation.

Annual passenger-kms per
capita fell dramatically during
the COVID-19 pandemic after
a decade of sustained growth.
